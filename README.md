# FLOW BEGINNER COURSE MODULE 3

This is a simple program demonstrating the implementation of Student Record on the Cadence playground.

## Description

The project has 3 codes: StudentRecord.cdc, Transactions.cdc and Scripts.cdc which implements the Storing and retrival of student's data in cadence playground.

StudentRecord.cdc has the cadence contract which is deployed on the cadence playground.

Script.cdc contains a code to read the query and retrieve information about a student's record from a blockchain smart contract, specifically from the StudentRecord contract, based on the provided index

Transaction.cdc code defines a transaction script that allows the addition of a new student record to the StudentRecord contract on the blockchain. It takes the student's name, age, and grade as input parameters and logs a message to confirm the addition of the record.
